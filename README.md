This repository contains my data infrastructure, data colleciton and management project for the validation of Bloc 1 of the RNCP certificate. 

Here is the description of the project:

# Plan your trip with Kayak 

## Company's description üìá

<a href="https://www.kayak.com" target="_blank">Kayak</a> is a travel search engine that helps user plan their next trip at the best price.

## Project üöß

The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that **70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to**. 

In addition, user research shows that **people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand** which produced the content. 

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:

* Weather 
* Hotels in the area 

The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time. 

## Goals üéØ

As the project has just started, your team doesn't have any data that can be used to create this application. Therefore, your job will be to: 

* Scrape data from destinations 
* Get weather data from each destination 
* Get hotels' info about each destination
* Store all the information above in a data lake
* Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse


## Scope of this project üñºÔ∏è

Marketing team wants to focus first on the best cities to travel to in France. According <a href="https://one-week-in.com/35-cities-to-visit-in-france/" target="_blank">One Week In.com</a> here are the top-35 cities to visit in France: 

```python 
["Mont Saint Michel",
"St Malo",
"Bayeux",
"Le Havre",
"Rouen",
"Paris",
"Amiens",
"Lille",
"Strasbourg",
"Chateau du Haut Koenigsbourg",
"Colmar",
"Eguisheim",

```

## Deliverable üì¨

To complete this project, your team should deliver:

* A `.csv` file in an S3 bucket containing enriched information about weather and hotels for each french city

* A SQL Database where we should be able to get the same cleaned data from S3 

* Two maps where you should have a Top-5 destinations and a Top-20 hotels in the area. You can use plotly or any other library to do so. It should look something like this:

## In this repository you will find:
- Kayak_project.ipynb in which you can see the explanations, API requests, boto3 commands, SQL queries on a AWS RDS database and visualizations
- 2 python scripts: scrapy_bookings.py and scrapy_coordinates.py which contain the spiders to scrap hotel data from booking.com 
- a _src_ folder in which you can find the data scraped from booking in .json format.
